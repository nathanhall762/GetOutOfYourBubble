Get Out of Your Bubble is a website where the user reads the prompt, clicks the button, and receives dynamically served bubble-popping API results formatted inside styled containers. This content is intended to get a user "out of their bubble" by suggesting potentitally never-thought-of-before activities and news articles from around the world.

## Instructions
NewsAPI forces requests to be made from localserver or server-side. To explore the functionality of *Get Out of Your Bubble*, please clone this repository and run it on your local testing server.

If you are not interested in the NewsAPI functionality, the webpage is hosted at nathanhall762.github.io. The bubbles will still propagate with BoredAPI activity suggestions!

```
git clone https://github.com/nathanhall762/GetOutOfYourBubble.git
```
## Known Bugs
The image file paths in the ```style.css``` file may not be correct for your system in order to render the webpage in your browser. These file paths exist in the ```.bubble``` and ```.master-grid``` classes. If the images are not rendering, change the file paths from ```./images``` to ```/images```.
